# Fun-Game
This is a game that is technically possible to win but very hard to win. DO NOT PLAY ON WINDOWS

I made this based off of a screenshot of a twitter (or X) post that is a game where you choose a number between one hundered and ten thousand. If you get the number wrong then the Windows operating system will get deleted. All I did was modify it a little bit.
